# Rejection (from [Eric Elliott's Learn Javascript coure](https://github.com/learn-javascript-courses/rejection))

## Getting Started

TODO: You can see the live version [here](./)

## Developing

Following a test-driven approach we recommend the following:

1. `yarn start` to start the hot-reloading development server
2. `yarn test` to start the hot-reloading test server

Then work against your test files, watching as your product falls into place.
